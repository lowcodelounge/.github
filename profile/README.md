## Why low-code design and development?

### üï∫ Get down with Markdown and go content-first
The most important thing people interact with on your page is the content. This is why they‚Äôre there ‚Äî either to get information or get something done. So let go of lorem ipsum and start testing your content first. Markdown makes it easy to format your text without messy HTML tags.

### üëã Goodbye hotspot‚Ä¶ hello hyperlink
Hotspot-based design and prototyping tools are nice, but there‚Äôs nothing like interacting with a real website on a real device for seeing how users actually respond to your hypothesis. And as easy as it is to build in the browser, you‚Äôll spend less time futzing around in Figma and more time validating your ideas.

### ‚ôº Stop annotating and start iterating
Working with an accessibility-aware, mobile-friendly design system allows you to focus more on collaboration with developers and less on communicating design details. The U.S. Web Design System includes a robust set of well-documented components that work out of the box. Even if you‚Äôre already using a design system, this approach covers the basics so you can concentrate on what makes your design unique.

## Who is it for?

You can use low-code prototyping at almost any point in the product design and development process. It‚Äôs helpful for designers who want to be more confident about what direction they‚Äôre recommending. It‚Äôs helpful for creators who want to bring their ideas to life without spending a lot of time and money on traditional software development. All it takes is some comfort with text files and a little bit of patience.

## What makes this different?

### üßë‚Äçüé® Non-developer audience
Many code-based tools are understandably geared towards software developers. But as tools have become more sophisticated and the developer experience has improved and started to align with conventional usability principles, they‚Äôve become much more accessible for people with a development background. The tools and techniques we focus on here are intended for a non-developer audience ‚Äî people who like to tinker and build to try things out without the seriousness of production-level code. 

### üí∏ Free and open-source tools
The no-code and low-code marketplace is exploding with all kinds of tools. And that‚Äôs awesome. There are lots of ways to take an idea to a working product very quickly, in some cases for free. But you need to upgrade to paid plans and lock in to a particular platform once you progress far enough. That‚Äôs perfectly fine, but we will focus here on options that might require a little more technical knowhow but with the benefit of not being locked into paid plans or platforms.

## What‚Äôs here?
Lowcode Lounge will focus on creating and curating projects that align with the mindset and methods described above. In most cases, that will mean public repositories that are set up to be used as templates with the goal of making them as straightforward and easy as possible for our intentded audience to reuse for their own learning and projects.
